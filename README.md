## üìÑ Scope

This repository contains the complete R pipeline and supplementary materials used for the analysis presented in the manuscript.  
The study evaluates the **systemic immunomodulatory effects** of non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) through:

- Comprehensive **meta-analysis**  
- **Spline-based meta-regression** of early-phase inflammatory markers:  
  - **TNF-Œ±**  
  - **IL-1Œ≤**  
  - **IL-6**  
  - **(hs)CRP**

### üîç Objective

To explore how localized mucosal inflammation from periodontal disease affects **systemic immune responses** over time.  
Using >14,000 pre-post intervention data points, the analysis reveals:

- Statistically significant **reduction in inflammatory cytokines** post-NSPT  
- Greater effect in **younger** and **non-smoking** individuals  
- Indications of a **temporal rebound effect** in cytokine suppression

### üåç Clinical and Translational Relevance

Findings highlight the contribution of oral inflammatory disease to **systemic low-grade inflammation**, with implications for:

- **Cardiovascular risk**  
- **Metabolic disease**  
- **Personalized inflammation control**
